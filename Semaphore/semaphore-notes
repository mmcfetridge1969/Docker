Need to create two files:

In order to ensure Semaphore can run commands properly, weâ€™ll need a line similar to the one below added to /etc/sudoers.d/semaphore on the target (the instance that our Semaphore server will be configuring). Be sure to replace semaphore in both the file name and inside the file to match the username of the user you intend to use with Semaphore.

semaphore file
semaphore ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

miker file
miker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Need to be logged into Ubuntu03, go to the .ssh directory and run the following command to copy over the rsa.pub file.
scp id_rsa.pub miker@192.168.0.181:/home/miker/.ssh
or
ssh-copy-id miker@192.168.0.185
