Hestia Control Panel Setup

** 1. Change to sudo **

sudo su -

** 2. Get the install script **

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/release/install/hst-install.sh


** 3. Important - CHANGE THE NEXT LINE TO USE YOUR OWN DETAILS, recommend using a subdomain like 'hcp' for your panel as I've done here **
bash hst-install.sh --interactive no --email admin@mcfetridge.us --password S>>>>>>>>123 --hostname hcp.mcfetridge.us -f

** Make sure to capture this information

For a smoother setup you can point the subdomain for your hostname over to the Oracle public IP address. In our video we used Namecheap, but all domain hosts will have a similar setup.

After installing, the ports youâ€™ll need to add to your ingress rules are here:

8083,80,443,143,993,110,995,25,465,587
